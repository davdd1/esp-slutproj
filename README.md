# Datorkommunikation Slutprojekt

This repository contains firmware and source code for an ESP-based project featuring BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) WiFi provisioning. The BLE stack is implemented using NimBLE, offering efficient and reliable communication for IoT devices.

## Features

- **BLE WiFi Provisioning:**  
  Seamlessly configure WiFi credentials via Bluetooth Low Energy, allowing for easy device setup without the need for hardcoded WiFi information or serial connections.

- **NimBLE BLE Stack:**  
  Utilizes the lightweight and robust NimBLE library for BLE functionality, ensuring low memory usage and high performance on ESP microcontrollers.

- **ESP Platform:**  
  Designed for ESP32/ESP8266 devices, taking advantage of their wireless capabilities and flexibility for embedded applications.

## Project Highlights

- Simple and secure onboarding experience for users through BLE.
- Modular codebase for easy customization and extension.
- Built with modern C/C++ and ESP-IDF (ESP IoT Development Framework).
